# Pony Town Auto-Recruiter
> [!WARNING]
> The Augmented version of this code is for testing / research purposes only. I do not condone any actual use of it on Pony Town's official servers, nor will I ever do so. 

 
This project gives the user two choices to pick from:
- `Basic`
- `Augmented`

 
Basic is a simple notification ping that tells you it's time to recruit again. There is no other automation other than that. <br>You can change how long the program will wait before sending a reminder again with the Start-Sleep function.


Augmented is an actual automated script which recruits (and counts) for you. All timed code inside the Python file is randomized using floating points, giving much more varied results than simple seconds.<br>
In order to properly run this file, you must open Powershell and install PyGUIAuto with `py -m pip install pyautogui`. 
<br>Afterwards, copy your recruitment message to the clipboard, start up the program, and sit at docks. 
<br>Like Basic, you are able to easily change how long the program will wait until sending a message.
